        <h4>A Rant About "Technology"</h4>
        <p>Not the metal, nor the wire,</p>
        <p>not the circuit, nor the fire—</p>
            <p>technology is in the hand</p>
                <p>before the hammer strikes the land.</p>
<br>
                    <p>Not the iron, nor the steel,</p>
                        <p>not the factory’s turning wheel—</p>
                            <p>it is the weaver’s threading light,</p>
                                <p>it is the poet’s shaping sight.</p>

                                    <p>A stone was lifted, shaped with care,</p>
                                    <p>the simplest tools made worlds aware.</p>
                                    <p>Not just progress, speed, or might,</p>
                                    <p>but a candle’s glow against the night.</p>
<br>
                                    <p>A cradle woven out of reed,</p>
                                    <p>a story told, a thought set free.</p>
                                    <p>Not the warship, not the gun—</p>
                                    <p>but the ways we hold the sun.</p>

                                    <p>What is made, and how, and why—</p>
                                    <p>who speaks, who builds, who lives, who dies?</p>
                                    <p>Not all that gleams is truly bright,</p>
                                    <p>not all that hums is wrought with light.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>For hands that shape the earth and sky</p>
                                    <p>must ask the question, not just why,</p>
                                    <p>but for whom, and to what end—</p>
                                    <p>and whether power should ascend.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>So pause before the wheel runs wild,</p>
                                    <p>remember hands, remember child.</p>
                                    <p>For true technology, it seems,</p>
                                    <p>is born from care, not conquest dreams.</p>

        <h4>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h4>
        

<p>Laurel Schwulst’s essay reimagines the website not as a fixed, sterile structure but as a dynamic, living space—one that evolves, breathes, and responds to its creator. This perspective challenges the rigid, utilitarian approach to digital spaces, urging us to see websites as fluid extensions of ourselves, capable of personal expression, intimacy, and organic growth.</p>

<p>I find her metaphor of a “shifting house” particularly compelling. It suggests that a website, like a home, is not just a tool but a place of habitation, shaped by its inhabitants and visitors. It can be welcoming or closed-off, minimal or abundant, transient or archival. This resonates with the idea that technology should not just serve efficiency but also nurture a sense of belonging and creativity.</p>

<p>Schwulst’s essay makes me reconsider my own digital presence. Instead of treating websites as static portfolios or functional repositories, what if they were gardens—spaces of continuous care and cultivation? This approach shifts the focus from mere presentation to ongoing process, from perfection to evolution.</p>

<p>Ultimately, her words serve as an invitation to rethink how we engage with the web—not just as users, but as hosts, storytellers, and caretakers of the digital spaces we inhabit.</p>

        <p><strong>Reflection on <em>The Handmade Web</em> by J.R. Carpenter</strong></p>

<p>J.R. Carpenter’s <em>The Handmade Web</em> reclaims digital creation as a craft—personal, imperfect, and full of agency. She contrasts the early web’s DIY spirit with today’s platform-driven uniformity, reminding us that websites can be intimate, experimental, and poetic.</p>

<p>Her essay makes me reconsider my own digital presence. How much of it is truly <em>mine</em>? Embracing the quirks of handmade web-making could restore a sense of creativity and ownership in a space increasingly dominated by templates and algorithms.</p>
